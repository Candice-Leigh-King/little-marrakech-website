      And I am from Morocco. <br> Let me introduce you to the best Moroccan food
      in Phuket! <br>Moroccan food, in its diversity and delicacy, is among the
      best in the world. This is due to the Kingdom's interaction with the
      outside world for centuries. In our cooking, there is a mixture of Amazigh
      and Arab that can be found in every Moroccan mother's kitchen. From the
      Maghreb to the Middle East, Mediterranean and Africa, Moroccan food is
      rich in flavor and culture. It is a pure reflection of our history the
      different tribes that once lived there. This cultural fusion makes
      Moroccan gastronomy one of the richest in the world! <br> Today, I'm here
      to present you the most important and famous traditional Moroccan dishes
      that are cooked in every house and made with love! <br>Travel with me to
      the land of dreams and let me show you my culture and our history through
      these delicious dishes. <br>Welcome to Little Marrakech!

      Batbout is a type of Moroccan bread made from semolina, very tasty (loved
      by all my Homa Homies)! It is appreciated for its soft and consistent
      texture, perfect to accompany dishes in sauce and also for your breakfast
      in the morning.   

      Another way to taste it is to simply dip it in olive oil and
      honey;)                                   PS: Pack of 8

    heading: ENERGY BALLS
    description: >-
      Energy Balls are a combination of dried fruit, peanut butter, oeat meal,
      and other ingredient add-ins that offer a densely nutritious snack in a
      little ball. They taste like dessert, but are actually good for you! They
      are full with nutrients, made with super food and whole food, high in
      protein, healthy carbs, fats, and fiber, which helps build lean muscle
      mass, boost energy and aid weight maintenance. Essentially, they are
      simply the guilt-free, energy hit and the perfect
      snack!                           PS: Pack of 10 pieces
