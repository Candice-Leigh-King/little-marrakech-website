      Maghreb to the Middle East, Mediterranean and Africa, Moroccan food is
      rich in flavor and culture. It is a pure reflection of our history the
      different tribes that once lived there. This cultural fusion makes
      Moroccan gastronomy one of the richest in the world! <br> Today, I'm here
      to present you the most important and famous traditional Moroccan dishes
      that are cooked in every house and made with love! <br>Travel with me to

    heading: AMLOU
    description: >
      Amlou the Berber spread, is a culinary preparation from the Souss region
      that the Chleuhs are used to eating. A tasty blend of grilled almonds,
      natural honey and argan oil. Ultra healthy, nutritious and gourmet that
      will make your taste buds travel. Nicknamed the Moroccan Nutella but
      obviously better ;) Amlou is a refined dish, a health ally par excellence,
      it is a real energy bomb rich in vitamins E, antioxidants, omega 9 and 6
      and proteins with this mixture which has a host of benefits and healing
      properties, and the Argan oil contains twice as much vitamin E as olive
      oil.

      spread on fresh homemade bread, on Baghrir, pancakes, Harcha, it also
      accompanies all kinds of pastries!    NB: 1 Glass Jar of 210ML

    heading: BAGHRIR
    description: >
      The Baghrir is the essential element of Moroccan Cuisine, it is not really
      a crepe, nor a pancake, no more than a blinis, it is quite simply the
      baghrir ;) Also called in French crÃªpe thousand holes.

      The term Baghrir comes from the Berber root â´±âµ–âµ”, widespread throughout the
      Maghreb based on semolina. A real delight that transports you to the foot
      of the Atlas, with the sweet flavors of Berber cuisine.

      And now, you can taste your delicious Baghrirs by coating them with Amlou,
      Jam, Honey, Nutella... But the most gourmet will love the traditional
      recipe based on Honey melted with Butter. NB : 1 Pack of 8 pieces

    description: >+
      Head to the Middle Atlas with these pancakes made from semolina, butter
      and milk with a sandy texture that melts in the mouth. When we start we
      never stop :)

      The Harcha (Ø­ÙŽØ±Ù’Ø´ÙŽØ©) spread throughout Morocco from the Middle Atlas
      Mountains where a population of Berber origin lived.

      This pancake is mainly served with mint tea and honey during breakfast or
      during snacks. If you've never tried a pancake made with semolina, now is
      the time ;)  NB : 1 Pack of 6 pieces
