      and Arab that can be found in every Moroccan mother's kitchen. From the
      Maghreb to the Middle East, Mediterranean and Africa, Moroccan food is
      rich in flavor and culture. It is a pure reflection our history the
      different tribs that once lived there. This cultral fusion makes Moroccan
      gastronomy one of the richest in the world! <br> Today, I'm here to
      present you with the most important and famous traditional Moroccan dishes
      that are cooked in every house and made with love! <br>Travel with me to
      the land of dreams and let me show you my culture and our history through
      these delicious dishes. <br>Welcome to Little Marrakech!

    description: >-
      The delish Tajine represents a typical style of Morocco cooking. With
      spices, textures and exotic flavors, tajine appeals to the senses. It's a
      culinary journey to Moroccan culture with tender chicken and soft
      vegetables. One try is enough to understand exactly what I'm talking
      about!! ;)

      Harira is a typical dish of the Moroccan gastronomic tradition. It is a
      very rich and nutritious soup filled with chickpeas, rice and lentils.
      Since Harira is known to be a dish of a generous portion, it is very
      popular during the month of Ramadan! Try this tasty soup and your taste
      buds with thank you. It is also served with juicy energy balls and boiled
      egg; perfect for a lunch-time meal. ;)
